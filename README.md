# Lycraons-Walltaker-BBD-plugin
A plugin for BandagedBetterDiscord that sets your Background to an e621 post from your Walltaker link

# Info
This is just a fun project.

The **more resurceful way** of showing your background would be to **activate transparent window** in BBD settings and s
elect an transparent themen (one with transparent background don't just look at tag or name).

#To-Do:
- Show Pictures from folders. (/ Get pictures + data from Walltaker desktop-client) 
  this would save internet capacity while useing other clients.
  
- Implement an option to change interval while Game-Activity is active
