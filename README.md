# Lycraons-Walltaker-BBD-plugin
A plugin for BandagedBetterDiscord that sets your Background to an e621 post from your Walltaker link

# Info
This is just a fun project.

The **more resurceful way** of showing your background would be to **activate transparent window** in BBD settings and s
elect an transparent themen (one with transparent background don't just look at tag or name).

Please **deactivate themes** for this plugin to work correctly.

# Settings

- Link-Id: Id of your Walltaker Link

- Image-Fit: how size of Backgroundimage is scaled
  - cover: zooms picture until it covers full window
  - contain: zooms picture until width or height is filled
  - fill width: zooms picture until width is filled
  - fill height: zooms picture until height is filled
  - stretch: picture is stretched to fit into window bounds
  - auto: automatically chooses between cover and contain
  - none: picture is shown 1:1 (the picture may still be influenced by window bounds)
